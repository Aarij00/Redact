```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

2. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

3. Start the Flask microservice:
```bash
cd flask-app
python app.py
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Resume Submission**:
   - Candidates submit their resume and optionally provide GitHub/LinkedIn profiles
   - System processes the PDF resume and scrapes provided professional profiles

2. **AI Processing**:
   - LangChain orchestrates the processing pipeline
   - OpenAI analyzes the content and identifies potentially biasing information
   - Creates a standardized, bias-free version of the resume
   - Extracts and incorporates relevant information from GitHub/LinkedIn profiles

3. **Anonymization**:
   - Generates anonymous email aliases for communication
   - Creates unique candidate IDs for tracking
   - Stores original information securely for later stages

4. **HR Review**:
   - HR managers receive standardized, bias-free applications
   - All candidates are evaluated purely on merit and qualifications
   - Communication maintains anonymity through secure channels
